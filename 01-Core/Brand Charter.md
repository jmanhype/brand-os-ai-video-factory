# Brand Charter — AI Video Factory (Rebel + Lover)

## Identity

**Primary:** Rebel
**Secondary:** Lover
**Shadow (Not-Us):** Entertainer
**Aspirational:** Shaman · Networker · Detective · Provocateur

## Promise (1 sentence)

From blank to posted in one sitting.

## Enemy (1 word)

Overwhelm.

## Voice Rules (3–5)

- Direct over polite
- Demonstrate, don't speculate
- Zero fluff; receipts win
- Call it out when it's broken (Rebel)
- Respect consent + credit (Lover)

## Proof Rituals

- **Rogue Build** (10 min live) → start to posted on the call
- **Proof Wednesday** → before/after + one lesson

## Words

**Use (6):** ship, today, receipt, exact, consent, posted
**Avoid (6):** hype, hustle, secret, hack, passive, "$X/day"

## Risk Guardrails

- **Rebel:** attack systems, not people; cite sources; obey TOS
- **Lover:** consent & credit; collaboration over parasocial bait
- **Entertainer:** every post ends with a Call-to-Build

## Shadow Line

We are not here to perform. Outcomes > applause. No shock-for-shock.

## Definitions

**Ready:** headings complete; linked from pins/sales/guardrails
**Done:** status=final; pasted live; live_link set; Shadow check passed
