# RAPID RESPONSE (≤30 minutes, Rebel + Lover)

## When to run

- Breaking launch/news your audience cares about
- A viral clip you can replicate ethically (consent + credit)
- A platform change that breaks a "rule" we can call out & fix

## Protocol (30m cap)

**0–3m:** Source link(s) + 1-line take (Rebel: what's broken?)
**3–8m:** Angle + Track + Hook (≤8 words)
**8–12m:** Assets check (consent/credit) | Claims link if Product-Safe
**12–22m:** Build: 1 pass only; stabilize; export
**22–25m:** Post; Call-to-Build CTA
**25–30m:** Log as post; comment a source link & template

## Risk gate (must pass all)

- [ ] Consent/credit ✅
- [ ] No impersonation (voice style, not identity) ✅
- [ ] Call-to-Build present ✅
- [ ] If Product-Safe: claims linked + no hallucination ✅

## Angles (pick one)

- "This 'rule' is fiction — here's the 10-min way"
- "Don't do X; do this 3-step setup"
- "Proof: posted in one sitting"
